## End-to-End Real-Time Translation

Ailyz AI sits between your customers and your support team as an invisible interpreter. Incoming messages—whether chat, email, or voice transcripts—are translated on the fly into English, the lingua franca for your agents. Agents reply in English; Ailyz renders each response back into the customer’s native tongue, preserving formatting, emojis, and brand tone. No agent has to toggle interfaces or cut-and-paste text into external tools. Everything happens within the same workspace in under 300 milliseconds—a latency low enough to sustain natural conversation.


## Why Language Still Decides Loyalty

Language access is not a nice-to-have: it is a revenue filter. CSA Research’s multi-country study shows that **76 % of consumers prefer to buy in their own language,** and 40 % refuse to purchase otherwise. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} This preference extends past checkout to post-sale support—where a single misunderstanding can turn a customer into a critic.

## Operational Benefits for Support Teams

 **Faster Resolution Times.** Real-time translation cuts response delays dramatically; Deliveroo’s support team, for instance, raised first-call-resolution to 83 % and trimmed average handle time by 20 % after deploying neural machine translation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

 **Universal agent pool.**  Because every ticket appears in English, work can be routed to the first available specialist—no need to recruit dedicated French- or Japanese-speaking teams in each region.

**Lower costs.**   Juniper Research estimates that AI-driven translation and automation will save firms more than $11 billion per year by streamlining multilingual support. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Higher CSAT.**  Customers get help in words and cultural idioms they understand. Real-time translation consistently reduces wait times and boosts satisfaction scores. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Languages We Cover

Ailyz currently supports **120+ written languages** and auto-detects script direction (LTR/RTL). The top 25 languages—covering 90 % of global internet users—come with industry-tuned engines for e-commerce, SaaS, fintech, and travel. Glossary management ensures that product names, legal disclaimers, and measurement units stay consistent across every locale.

## Quality & Governance

Our hybrid workflow combines neural MT, large-language-model post-editing, and confidence scoring. Replies that fall below a quality threshold are automatically flagged for human review, satisfying the audit rules in the EU AI Act and sector-specific regulations. Full bilingual transcripts are stored for 30 days to aid dispute resolution and agent coaching.

## Unified Analytics Across Languages

By normalizing every customer utterance into English, Ailyz feeds a single knowledge base and sentiment pipeline. That means one set of dashboards for intent trends, churn predictors, and FAQ gaps—no more merging spreadsheets from different language teams. Translating outbound messages back into native languages is logged as metadata, so teams can still track which locales create the most volume.

## What's Next

In Q3 2025, Ailyz will add speech-to-speech mode for voice calls, as well as support for low-resource languages like Kinyarwanda and Haitian Creole through on-device models. Our roadmap also includes cultural style-guides generated by LLMs to help agents adapt tone—formal versus informal—per market.
